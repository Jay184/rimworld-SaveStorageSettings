  <description>Save and Load Dump/Stockpile and Outfit settings. These saves can be carried over from new games to old saves.

Future Plans: Add support for other types of Storage Zones.

Changes:
  Stockpiles:
    - Save Priorities.
    - Save Colors (Might be undesired, unless the mod to change the colors is installed).

  Food restrictions:
    - Can save and load just like outfits.

  Bills:
    - Count Equipped, count tainted, look in (stockpile), quality, only allowed ingredients, take to (stockpile), suspended now saved.

  Dialog:
  	- Saving textbar no longer overlaps the file list.

  Translation:
    - German
